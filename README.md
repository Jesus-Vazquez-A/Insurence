# Insurence-Proyect

### Definition of the problem.

Create a machine learning algorithm with the goal of estimating the health insurance charges.
To later use it to create an application and upload it to herouku.

### Features of dataset.

* Age  of the insured.
* BMI  body mass index.
* Children  Number of children of the insured.

* Charges  Health insurance price.


### Project composition


* Exploratory analysis.    We understand the nature of data
* Feature Engineering.     We remove or transform the outliers
* Search for the right model.   We make comparisons between different models. As well as looking for the best combination of parameters.
* Definitive model.   Create the best model again. And we save it for later use.
* App in  Streamlit.  We use streamlit which is a specialized library for data science. That allows us to create applications easily.


### Important notes.

The jupyter notebooks are in html format. For which you will have to download the compressed files. Praa be able to view it on your compute
